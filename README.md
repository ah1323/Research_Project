# The question:
Do Social Determinants of health influence hypertension and depression for older adults in Ghana?

# What we did:
1. Merging data from additional NHANES (at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx) data to the available clean dataset from cardioStatUSA (at https://github.com/jhs-hwg/cardioStatsUSA)
2. Removing unnecessary variables and data cleaning
3. Perform Elastic Net for variable selection
4. Fitting selected variables using Logistics regression
5. Perform Bayesian Logistics
6. Descriptive analysis of important variables

# What we found:
- Blood pressure control is significantly associated with hypertension awareness and the use of antihypertensive medication
- People with high BMI are more likely to be aware that they have hypertension
